==> In this workshop we use dynamic memory. It could be created by using ‘new’ command and its important to delete the memory after the use with ‘delete []’ command. Moreover, this was the first-time using arrays and structures together in oop workshop. This workshop had major part of file handling.  ‘deallocateMemory’ function was new to work with. This function frees dynamically allocated memory when its no longer needed. String manipulation was also part of the workshop.
