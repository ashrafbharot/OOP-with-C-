In this workshop I utilized all the learning from my previous workshops. I used dynamically allocated memory. I also used input and output stream. In this workshop the overloaded operator<< invoked the virtual write function, which varied its behavior based on the actual object. I worked with functions, memory management, conditional statement. I used abstract class as well. To perform my code well I used copy constructor.
