1. Study your final solutions for each deliverable of the workshop, reread the related parts of the course notes, and make sure that you have understood the concepts covered by this workshop. This should take no less than 30 minutes of your time and the result is suggested to be at least 150 words in length.
--> In this workshop I got familiarized with constructor and destructor. We also used dynamic memory allocation associated with name. Encapsulation and inheritance concepts were utilized to code this workshop. The class consisted of various private member variables like 	Name, passengerNum and DepartTime. I created three functions load, updateDepartureTime and transfer. The load function prompts the user to input the number of passengers boarding the train. It adds this count to the current passenger total. If the total surpasses the maximum capacity, it calculates the excess passengers and stores them in remainpassengers. If all passengers board successfully (no excess), it returns true; otherwise, it returns false to indicate capacity constraints. The updateDepartureTime asks the user for a new departure time, checks it against validTime and then modifies DepartTime. When it succeeds, it returns true; when it fails, it returns false. The transfer function combines passenger counts and names of two trains. It dynamically allocates memory for a combined name, concatenates the names with a comma and space, and updates the current train's name. It calculates the total passengers and returns true if within capacity, else false with a message about any passengers left behind.
